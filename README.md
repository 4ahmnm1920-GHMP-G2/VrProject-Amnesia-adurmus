# VrProject-Amnesia-adurmus

### Project description: 
The Protagonist suffers from memory loss and he wants to do something against it. he finds out that there is a new technology where he might get his memory back, so he volunteers to try it out. This new technological machine 
subconsciously takes him back to his old childhood bedroom, while he physically is asleep in a hospital room. In his room he has to solve riddles to gain his memory back. The more riddles he solves, the more memories he gets back but after every riddle he solves he realizes that he suppressed the memories on purpose because they were traumatic experiences. He also constantly thinks that someone is also there with him in his room because he hears footsteps and heavy breathing. 

### Locomotion 
For my Game I am going to use the Controller based locomotion typ, which means the Player 
has to use the controller to direct his movements. The motion is continuous and the Player will be artificially moved by utilizing the controllers.
